# PetHarbour

PetHarbour is a pet adoption platform that connects pet lovers with available pets in their area. The application consists of a frontend client built with modern web technologies and a backend server managing database operations and API requests.

---

## Starting the Project

Follow these steps to set up and start the application:

### 1. **Start the Client**
Navigate to the `client` directory and start the frontend:
```bash
cd client
npm start
```
This will start the client-side application. By default, it will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### 2. **Start the Server**
#### a) Main Server
Navigate to the `server` directory and start the backend server:
```bash
cd server
node index.js
```
This connects to the database and listens for API requests on port `8080`.

#### b) Server Endpoint (Optional)
If you have additional server endpoints, navigate to the `server/serverend` directory and start the server:
```bash
cd server/serverend
node index.js
```
This will start another server instance on port `5000`.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

---

## Additional Notes
- The application uses two ports:
  - **8080** for the primary server
  - **5000** for additional endpoints (if applicable)
- The database connection should be configured in the `server/index.js` file.
